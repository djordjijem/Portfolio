### Life
My whole life I've been attracted by things that require everyday practice, discipline, and consistency. The first time I met the Computer was around 94'. My best friend had 14 computers in his home (his father has a Ph.D. in CS) when we tried to figure out how to install and run the games. Ten years later two of us alongside with three other friends were battling for the spot at the world cup in [Counter-Strike 1.6](https://liquipedia.net/counterstrike/Electronic_Sports_World_Cup/2005) (Group 5, 6th spot). We were the first team from Balkans to accomplish that, and we did it by practicing. It taught me very early what you can achieve with practice, how to organize yourself etc.After that, I studied economics and worked at the local tennis club for 4 years (organization, trainings etc.),which also was very valuable expirience but it was boring.Then i played poker since that was the thing at the time. I played maybe three years, before realizing it's not me.I consider this the second most important thing I did up to that moment, through which I mastered patience, self-learning and discipline, analytical thinking and 'never give up' mentality. It became boring.Then in 2012, I decided to try myself in IT (wanted to attend Abitur/IT but was unable to enroll - conditions were strict, they wanted the best - I hated school, neither the worst nor best, had no chance). My previous experience was setting up gaming environment, fix the connection, tweak LAN connections, change some piece of hardware, etc...i started with HTML CSS jQuery, wanted to build a web site. It became boring after a few months, so I looked at some Java programming, PHP which is the thing in my area, and pretty much made every possible mistake beginner can make. I wanted to make the form, in which a user can log in and do something privately, then a CMS for some static website, etc. The breakthrough happened a year or a two later when I already was in Vienna, studying business-informatics. I was already able to write complex front-ends, but the real love started with 'Algorithm' classes. It blew my mind. I knew i will be a programmer. Shortly after that, we had the 'C' classes at the university, which is in my books the most useful thing one can do. It taught me two things: before you try something ask yourself why you need this and if you have an answer then go look at the root of the idea behind it.After that it felt i can learn anything.

### Work

- I've done freelance since 2014. Most of my professional work until 2016 involves building static sites and custom themes. My first commercial site for a local [restaurant](http://ristorante-chianti.at/) is still active, I have built another similar 4 or 5 sites.
- After that, I dedicated myself to learning, be part of the university dev team, did few short contracts during the summer break, as well as a member of [freeCodeCamp Vienna](https://fccvienna.github.io/) and [React Vienna](https://www.meetup.com/ReactVienna/) where I met great people from different cultures. During this time I was involved in a few big projects, but for NDA reasons cannot disclose details on that. I will provide a little portfolio of similar stuff.
- 2016 mai - october Front-end Developer @ Sipwise GmbH 
- 2017 july - november Front-end Developer @ IMS Nanofabrication GmbH
- 2018 I was a full-time member of [BovAcademy](https://bovacademy.com/) (currently a part-time member). There my skills were really tested, they pushed us beyond our limits every day, and that's probably the most important education in my dev career. I was involved in a few big projects there, like for example [AiHumanity](https://aihumanity.com/), but the very insignificant roles.
- 2019 since march I've been working for a local IT company in my area, both as Technical Support for ILO and DIP Servers and Front-End dev on their [app](https://testrest.devlabs.ba/).However i would prefer remote work, React/Node stack, but any other stack or technology would work if you have patience. I also realized that I want to be a part of some company or a startup. The sense of belonging makes me really happy.

### Education

- 2002-2006 Abitur/Technical school
- 2006-2010 [Economic university Banjaluka Bosnia](https://ef.unibl.org/), 200 ECTS (total 240)
- 2015-2018 [Vienna university of economics and business](https://www.wu.ac.at/en/) business informatics, I went there on six months period and stud three years. Costs became too high,i was limited with working permission so decided to came back, work full-time as a dev
- 2018-present Economic university Banjaluka Bosnia, business informatics; 80ECTS until graduation
- 2018-present [Bov Academy](https://bovacademy.com/) The program has perhaps the most comprehensive and rigorous curriculum and training for web programmers. Here I meet programmers of all levels, there is something for everyone. Work from here is mostly on my GitHub.

Other then this, i watched more than 1000 hours of videos on Lynda, Udemy, Youtube, doing challenges on [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/dashboard), contributed to [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), [Chingu](https://chingu.io/) ([one](https://chingu-news.netlify.com/) of the projects I did there), read all important books on JavaScript and programming in general, [currently reading](https://pragprog.com/book/rspec3/effective-testing-with-rspec-3), trying to figure out Hooks in React (which I like), [cypress](https://www.cypress.io/), reading about Serverless. I would like to learn typescript in the near future, and maybe Go.
