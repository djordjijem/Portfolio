### Life
My whole life I've been attracted by things that require everyday practice, discipline, and consistency. The first time I met the Computer was around 94'. My best friend had 14 computers in his home (his father has a Ph.D. in CS) when we tried to figure out how to install and run the games. Ten years later two of us alongside with three other friends were battling for the spot at the world cup in [Counter-Strike 1.6](https://liquipedia.net/counterstrike/Electronic_Sports_World_Cup/2005) (Group 5, 6th spot), which was a huge success for us at the time. We were the first team from Balkans to accomplish that, and we did it because we practiced (practicing video games for competitive play is everything except fun) every day for more than 5 years. It taught me what you can achieve with practice, how to organize yourself and a team, in some cases also we needed to invent new ways in order to pass challenges regarding competitive playing, organization and such things. In that time we hadn't realized that, of course, it will show up as useful ten years later (almost all are among the best today in their areas of expertise). After that, I studied economics and worked at the local tennis club, but it was all boring. Since I needed everyday repeat and practice, I started playing poker since that was the thing at the time. I played maybe three years, before realizing it's not me (also started to get bored after a few hours). I needed something more challenging. Poker is extremely hard, requires learning, playing and every day practicing, perfect for my personality. I consider this the second most important thing I did up to that moment, through which I mastered patience, self-learning and discipline, analytical thinking and 'never give up' mentality. But it wasn't enough anymore. Then sometime in 2012, I decided to try myself in IT (wanted to attend Abitur/IT but was unable to enroll - conditions were strict, they wanted the best - I hated school, nor worst nor best, had no chance). My previous experience was setting up gaming environment, fix the connection, tweak LAN connections, change some piece of hardware, etc...Everyone in my environment had basic or advanced programming knowledge, except me. My first encounter with programming was with HTML, CSS, and some jQuery. I wanted to build a web site. It became boring after a few months, so I looked at some Java programming, PHP which is the thing in my area, and pretty much made every possible mistake beginner can make. I wanted to make the form, in which a user can log in and do something privately, then a CMS for some static website, etc. The breakthrough happened a year or a two later when I already was in Vienna, studying business-informatics. I was already able to write complex front-ends, but the real love started one day during my usual morning algorithm practices; can't remember the exact problem, but it was something like this: there is a huge array, and you need to find some pattern of numbers, and I did that 5 days after finally gone to look for a solution. It had something to do with prime numbers and some searching algorithm combined together. It blew my mind! Shortly after that, we had C classes at the university, which is in my books the most useful thing one can do. It really opened my mind how everything fits together, and to be more grateful when I use 'console.log' and how much things needs to happen to provide us that simple functionality. After that, I felt I can do anything.

### Work

I've done freelance since 2014. Most of my professional work until 2016 involves building static sites. My first one for a local [restaurant](http://ristorante-chianti.at/) is still active, I have built other similar 4 or 5 sites which are inactive. After that, I dedicated myself to learning, be part of the university dev team, as well as a member of [freeCodeCamp Vienna](https://fccvienna.github.io/) and [React Vienna](https://www.meetup.com/ReactVienna/) where I met great people from different cultures. During this time I was involved in a few big projects, but for NDA reasons cannot disclose details on that. I will provide a little portfolio of similar stuff. Also, I was a full-time member of [BovAcademy](https://bovacademy.com/) in 2018 (currently a part-time member). There my skills were really tested, they pushed us beyond our limits every day, and that's probably the most important education in my dev career. I was involved in a few big projects there, like for example [AiHumanity](https://aihumanity.com/), but the very insignificant roles. Since March I've been working for a local IT company in my area, both as Technical Support for IoT Servers and Front-End dev on their [app](https://testrest.devlabs.ba/), most jQuery. It should've been temporary until some React/Vue project starts but, it hasn't happened so I decided to look for something else, already met the agreement to work until I find a new company. I would prefer remote work, React/Node stack, but any other stack or technology would work if you have patience. I also realized that I want to be a part of some company or a startup. The sense of belonging makes me really happy.

### Education

- 2002-2006 Abitur/Technical school
- 2006-2010 [Economic university Banjaluka Bosnia](https://ef.unibl.org/), 200 ECTS (total 240)
- 2015-2018 [Vienna university of economics and business](https://www.wu.ac.at/en/) business informatics, I went there on six months period and stud three years but the first one and a half year learned the German language every day. Earned around 60 ECTS before returning home. Reason for that was my initial university started with business-informatics and I could concentrate on a dev 24/7. In Vienna, I was limited with working hours with a student work permit, and since costs are higher it was a logical step for me.
- 2018-present Economic university Banjaluka Bosnia, business informatics; I need around 80ECTS to graduate
- 2018-present [Bov Academy](https://bovacademy.com/) The program has perhaps the most comprehensive and rigorous curriculum and training for web programmers. Here I meet programmers of all levels, there is something for everyone. Work from here is mostly on my GitHub.

Other then this, i watched more than 1000 hours of videos on Lynda, Udemy, Youtube, did challenges on Codewars, contributed to [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), [Chingu](https://chingu.io/) ([one](https://chingu-news.netlify.com/) of the projects I did there, that I can remember off), read all important books on JavaScript and programming in general, [currently reading](https://www.amazon.in/Node-js-Web-Development-David-Herron/dp/1785881507), trying to figure out Hooks in React (which I like), [cypress](https://www.cypress.io/), reading about Serverless. I would like to learn typescript in the near future, and maybe Go.
